# Basic Explanation

Adds budding and cluster certus blocks for an alternative to certus seeds. 1.7.10 only. You can find these budding certuses under the sky stone chests in meteorites. The budding certus is compatible with AE2 growth accelerators to a number of 5 that triples the generation speed. Seemed to be balanced to me, you can change the rate of both non accelerated and accelerated ones from config.

# WHY.

If you are here you probably thought to yourself, DAMN I hate AE2 certus seeds wish there was a mod for that! Well here I am. Making my modrinth page for EXACT SAME REASON. Because GOOD GOD DONT I **HATE** CERTUS SEED SYSTEM. This budding certus project was shelved for at least 4 times because I couldnt figure out how to make custom renderers for 1.7.10 but I believe this time its all working perfectly... Good... Functioning enough to share and sufficient enough to be used in my own pack.

Please for the love of god dont inspect any part of the code. This is a project that I slapped together in a week. While writing of this code only I and god knew how it worked, I think only god can tell what kind of impling I dragged from hell to be compiled by Gradle. With the cute elephant icon!

# It crashed/broke/bugged!

Of course it did, do I look like a professional software publisher to you? You can probably add me from discord (**polarite**) but I can never guarantee if I will be able to solve your bug. It shouldnt corrupt worlds and it shouldnt touch your parents ;) . But you never know. Back up your shit kids. including your parents. I guarantee jack shit, it worked in my machine.

## REQUIRES AE2 OBVIOUSLY. (prefably the gtnh ae2 fork.)

Special Thanks To:
* Wojak for his help and support and giving ideas!
* Et Futurum and NovaCraft for giving me the idea(yoinky sploinky) of cluster rendering and modelling.
* Applied energistics 2 for the idea and textures... And for ae2 itself for it is an amazing mod, let me tell you, folks, Applied Energistics 2—it's tremendous, absolutely tremendous. Nobody organizes items better than AE2, believe me. You’ve got storage cells, you’ve got auto-crafting, it’s like having the best factory—better than any factory in history. People come up to me and say, “Polarite, how do you manage your inventory?” I say, “Applied Energistics 2, of course!” The ME system—so smart, so elegant, it’s like the brain of Minecraft. Other mods? Sad! They try, but they just don’t have the energy, the applied energy. With AE2, you don’t just play Minecraft—you dominate it. It’s the kind of mod that wins, and we love winners, don’t we? So if you want to be successful, if you want to be great—use AE2.

Please dont use this source code, this is my first public mod, it fucking sucks.

PS: This isnt a malware, the source is open, I just went a bit too overboard with shitposting.
